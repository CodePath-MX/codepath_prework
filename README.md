# MaochengX_prework

**MaochengX_prework** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Maocheng Xiong**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Change the state of the segmented bar as not selected at the initial moment. Therefore, when open this app and type some number, you can select the first bar(15%) to calculate, instead of selecting another one and then selecting back.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Since I am totally new to Xcode and Swift, I don't know how to start many programs such as the animation, improving UI, and so on.
